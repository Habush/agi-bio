# Parse owl/obo file into scheme

download owl files:
- GO owl file here http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.owl
- GO-plus owl file http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/extensions/go-plus.owl

How to generate the scheme result:

python owl2atomese.py file_name

example:

python owl2atomese.py go-plus.owl



TODO:

The script imports everything in the owl/obo file, so preprocessing is needed to filter out 
unwanted relationships.
